    <p>
      In 2022, I graduated from the Econometrics department at Çukurova
      University, where I received comprehensive training in statistics, data
      analysis, and financial modeling. Throughout my education, I actively
      participated in projects, experiencing the benefits of effective teamwork
      and honing my skills in problem identification and solution-oriented
      approaches. I have developed a strong ability to solve complex problems
      and manage data efficiently. I am always open to enhancing my skills in
      solving challenging problems and managing data effectively. My goal is to
      apply my acquired analytical thinking and collaboration skills to
      contribute effectively to any work environment.
